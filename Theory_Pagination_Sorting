JpaRepository already extends PagingAndSortingRepository which provides methods to sort the posts and get
pages based on page numbers and page size.

Page<T> findAll(Pageable pageable); is a method used to get pages based on size and number of pages

Check getAllPost() in post service implementations to see how pagination is achieved.
