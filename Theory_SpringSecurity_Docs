Api's that we build are open to anyone and anybody can access them. To secure the api's we use spring security

In pom.xml file copy spring-boot-starter-web  dependency and paste it and change it to spring-boot-starter-security and save the project, wait for the
project to get build and if the building of project is not happening implicitly then update maven project and restart 
the server.

Now when we try to assess any api in postman we get 401 unauthorized error

Spring security will by default provide a unsername as "user" and generates a random password each time the server is running

Spring security by default using form based authentication which can be accessed only in browser, it will ask for username
and password.

copy the end point in the browser search engine and enter the user name and password generated by spring security

Once it is logged in the login session will be active hence we can access other api's as well. If we want 
to logout then we need to pass logout in url.

i.e., localhost:8082/login?logout

we can customize out spring security user name and password by configuring them in the application.properties file
as shown below:
